          <Text as="p">
            My name is <strong>Adriano Lima</strong>, I am from Brazil and have
            been passionate about sim racing since 2010. I started with rFactor
            and later explored other simulators until I finally gave iRacing a
            chance in 2020. Sim racing has always been a hobby for me, but
            recently, I've been working to improve my driving techniques.

          <Text as="p" mt={2}>
            As a software developer, I've always enjoyed exploring iRacing APIs.
            In the past, I created a Twitch bot and an Overlay prototype, and
            now I'm excited to present this project. Every season, I find myself
            wondering which tracks and cars to purchase. This tool was initially
            designed to address my own needs, but I hope it will also be helpful
            to the broader iRacing community.
